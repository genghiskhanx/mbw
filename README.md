# mbw
My first git attempt: Satisfactory Modding.
I don't know much programming, it's all self-taught.  "mbw" stands for "Mongolian BattleWorks." The first
game I ever modded was Total Annihilation back in the late 90s. At the time the fashion was to host a
website with a cool sounding name on one of the TA modding websites. (Such as TAUniverse.com, which is,
incidentally, still operating.) I've been using the screen name GenghisKhanX since that time, and I called
my website Mongolian BattleWorks. I am not, even partly, related to the real Genghis Khan (that I know of,
he kind of spread his genetic material around), nor am I Mongolian by birth. I just have always loved the 
culture and history of the nation.
